Question: How is the communication between the host and the graphic card handled?
clCreateBuffer & clSetKernelArg functions are used pass data between card and host

Question: What function executes your kernel?
clEnqueueNDRangeKernel

Question: How does the kernel know what element to work on?
clSetKernelArg -> a,b,c recognised by patterns and get_global_id(0) used to get thread id

QUESTION: What timing did you get for your GPU reduction? Compare it to the CPU version.

CPU 0.000007
GPU reduction.
GPU 0.000979

QUESTION: Try larger data size. On what size does the GPU version get faster, or at least comparable, to the CPU?

33554432
CPU 0.056660
GPU reduction.
GPU 0.055731

QUESTION: How can you optimize this further? You should know at least one way.
Pyramid

QUESTION: Should each thread produce one output or two? Why?
No half of the threads never work and this decreases.

QUESTION: How many items can you handle in one workgroup?
1024

QUESTION: What problem must be solved when you use more than one workgroup? How did you solve it?
We did not encounter that issue what is your insight.

QUESTION: What time do you get? Difference to the CPU? What is the break even size? What can you expect for a parallel CPU version? (Your conclusions here may vary between the labs.)
CPU sorting.
CPU 0.008140
GPU sorting.
GPU 0.101178

#define kDataLength 32*2048
CPU sorting.
CPU 0.041362
GPU sorting.
GPU 0.395749

Number of threads is contant. So, does not scale but more power efficent.
